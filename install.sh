Panes is now running in the menu bar.

First-run setup
  1. Grant Accessibility when prompted (System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸
     Accessibility). Panes needs it to move windows and to take its shortcuts
     before the front app sees them. Until granted, the menu shows
     "⚠ Grant Accessibility…"; Panes starts working the moment you allow it.
  2. Optional: Settings ▸ Start at Login.

Try it: ⌥⌘← / ⌥⌘→ for halves, ⌥⌘M to maximize, ⌥⌘⌫ to undo the last move;
drag a window's title bar to a display edge; or pick cells in the grid at the
top of the menu.
